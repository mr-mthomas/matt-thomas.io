![Matt Thomas](/img/mt.jpg)

My name is Matt Thomas, I am a senior manager at Warner Bros. Discovery. Prior to my current role, I was a broadcast sound supervisor and guarantee for BBC Sport. My passion for technology started as a small child, where my obsession with computers and general tinkering with electronics evolved into an interest in all things broadcast and IT.

Over the last decade, I have witnessed a gradual convergence of broadcast and IT. This a tremendously exciting time for both production and technical teams within the industry. And I am happy to be working with some of the best in the business.
