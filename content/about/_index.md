My name is Matt Thomas, I am a Senior Manager at Warner Bros. Discovery. Prior to my current role, I was a broadcast Sound Supervisor and Guarantee at BBC Sport. My passion for technology started as a small child, where my obsession with computers and general tinkering with electronics evolved into an interest in all things broadcast sound, communications and IT.

The broadcasting industry is undergoing a significant transformation with the transition from traditional SDI to IP infrastructure. This shift is not just a change in technology; it's a leap towards more agile, flexible, and scalable broadcasting operations.

As we embrace IP's potential, we're witnessing a convergence of broadcast and IT that promises to revolutionise content delivery. With IP, broadcasters can easily adapt to the ever-increasing demand for high-resolution content and multi-platform distribution, ensuring a seamless viewer experience across various devices.

This transition is a journey, one that requires careful planning and execution. But the benefits – cost efficiency, improved workflow, and future-proofing our industry – make it a venture worth pursuing. Let's navigate this change together, leveraging the power of IP to create a more dynamic and connected media world.
